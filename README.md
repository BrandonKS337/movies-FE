## Movies-App

##### This application is a practical practice project focusing on developing a movie display web portal using IMDB resources.

The tech stack is built using the following
`` FE: React, Bootstrap, Axios, FontAwesome, React-player, React-Router, MUI ``
`` BE: Mongodb, Java, Spring ``

To clarify the Mongodb is actually tied to Mongo Atlas and if you would like to utilize this project for yourself you will need to setup an account prior to getting rolling.

##### Getting Started
```$ git clone```

```$ cd movies-fe```

```$ npm i```

```$ npm start ```

after this is done you should see the URL localhost:3000 in your terminal letting you know that the project is up and running. Copy and paste that into your webBrowser and boom there you go!

For the Backend Project details please refer to the movies-api repository at https://github.com/BrandonKS337/movies-api and follow the README.md instructions on the setup/run process.
